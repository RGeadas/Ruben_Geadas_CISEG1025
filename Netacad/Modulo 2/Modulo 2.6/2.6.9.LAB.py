# Scenario
# Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.

# The results have to be printed to the console.

# You may not be able to protect the code from a user who wants to divide by zero. That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

# Test your code ‒ does it produce the results you expect?

# We won't show you any test data ‒ that would be too simple.

a = float(input("Insert a first value: "))  # input a float value for variable a here
b = float(input("Insert a second value: ")) # input a float value for variable b here

print("The result of addiction is: ", a + b)# output the result of addition here
print("The result of subtraction is: ", a - b)# output the result of subtraction here
print("The result of multiplication is: ", a * b)# output the result of multiplication here
print("The result of division is: ", a / b)# output the result of division here

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
